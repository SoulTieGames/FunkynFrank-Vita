# FunkynFrank-Vita
Twin-stick shooter port for the PS Vita

This is a port of Funky n Frank for the PS Vita. It is originally a PC game with a full-blown campaign mode that I made years ago.
The PS-Vita version ONLY INCLUDES THE SURVIVAL MODE, and only the "Forest" level. 
Adding the campaign mode would require a rewrite of the engine, because of the Vita's hardware restraints.
Bummer. Still, the forest is a fun survival level. If I find time, I might port over a few other survival levels eventually.
Don't hold your breath for the campaign mode though.
If you've ever played the PC version, you know the sandworms are super fun to fight. I haven't added those to the Vita yet, but I plan to.

KNOWN ISSUES
 If you choose Frank as your character, melee weapons won't work. Either Choose Funky for your character, or only use firearms.
 The framerate drops significantly in the pause menu, but it still works.
